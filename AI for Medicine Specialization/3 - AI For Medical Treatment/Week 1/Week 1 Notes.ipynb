It is calculated by subtracting the risk of an event occurring in the control group from the risk of the same event occurring in the treatment group.\n",

The trial recruits 1,000 patients, with 500 randomly assigned to receive the new medication and 500 assigned to receive a placebo. After one year, 10 patients in the treatment group experienced a heart attack, while 20 patients in the placebo group experienced a heart attack.\n",

    "Causal inference is the process of determining whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between two or more variables in a given system. In other words, it is the process of determining whether one variable directly causes another variable to change.\n",

    "Causal inference is important in scientific research because it helps researchers to understand the underlying mechanisms of a system, and to determine the effectiveness of interventions. However, establishing causal relationships can be challenging, and there are many factors that need to be considered in order to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to establish a causal relationship between two variables, several conditions must be met. First, there must be a plausible mechanism by which the cause can lead to the effect. Second, there must be a temporal relationship between the cause and the effect, with the cause occurring before the effect. Third, there must be a correlation between the cause and the effect, meaning that changes in the cause are associated with changes in the effect. Finally, other potential causes must be ruled out, so that the observed relationship between the cause and the effect is not spurious.\n",

    "One of the main challenges in causal inference is dealing with confounding variables, which are other factors that may influence both the cause and the effect. In order to minimize the impact of confounding variables, researchers may use methods such as randomization, matching, and statistical modeling.\n",
